# Participation
Please note that we have a strict [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in our open source radionics project.

As for the participation there are several possibilities.

If you are a developer with skills in Java 1.8, Maven 3, JSON and Javascript and you know modern collaboration techniques like git / branching / forking, then you are welcome to create a fork and make a pull request. After review of your code contribution the core team decide if it will be integrated into the master branch.

Another possibility is to open issues for bugs, new features, improvemenents and so on. Note that we don't tolerate features for magical and manipulative purposes, this includes all "whishing machines" features. The AetherOne project is a holistic approach as the original radionic from Dr. Abrams was, not a coward technology for manipulation. Such attempts leads to blocking. For new rate lists contribution a [separate repository](https://github.com/isuretpolos/radionics-rates) exists.

Also feel free to promote the project with your own documentation or blog posts. You can send me per email a link and after review the link will be inserted here on Github.
