## User manual (READ IT)
**Please read first the [AetherOnePi User Manual](https://radionics.home.blog/aetheonepi/)**, because it explains **step by step** the most important features and techniques for analysis and broadcasting.

A video series explaining the software will follow.

## Java 24 runtime
You need Java 24 as a runtime. Download it from [oracle.com](https://www.oracle.com/de/java/technologies/downloads/) and install it before you run the AetherOnePi application on your PC (Windows / Linux), Mac or Raspberry Pi.

## Download
Download [Version 2.0.0](https://github.com/isuretpolos/AetherOnePi/releases/tag/v2.0.0)

or download the Beta which is build after each change on the [Action tab](https://github.com/isuretpolos/AetherOnePi/actions). Just click on the Build Element and in the upper right corner you will see a Artifact Download Button if the build was a success.

# Participation
Please note that we have a strict [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in our open source radionics project.

As for the participation there are several possibilities.

If you are a developer with skills in Java 1.8, Maven 3, JSON and Javascript and you know modern collaboration techniques like git / branching / forking, then you are welcome to create a fork and make a pull request. After review your code contribution the core team decide if it will be integrated into the master branch.

Another possibility is to open issues for bugs, new features, improvements and so on. Note that we don't tolerate features for magical and manipulative purposes, this includes all "whishing machines" features. The AetherOne project is a holistic approach as the original radionic from Dr. Abrams was, not a coward technology for manipulation. Such attempts leads to blocking. For new rate lists contribution a [separate repository](https://github.com/isuretpolos/radionics-rates) exists.

Also feel free to promote the project with your own documentation or blog posts. You can send me per [email](isuret.polos@gmail.com) a link and after review the link will be inserted here on Github.
