    "Characteristics" : [ "Mitchella is a small trailing evergreen bearing a scarlet bean, and is common throughout the United States. It belongs to the same order as China, Coffea, and Ipecac., and shows its affinity with these in its power over haemorrhages. Indian women drink a decoction of it before confinement to make labour safe and easy. Eclectics use a concentrated decoction as an application to sore nipples. T. C. Duncan, in his proving, induced pains and burning in the kidneys, and H. P. Hale, who observed the effect on a woman, has recorded some characteristic symptoms in the urinary and uterine sphere. A leading indication is congestion of the uterus with bladder irritation as a concomitant." ],
