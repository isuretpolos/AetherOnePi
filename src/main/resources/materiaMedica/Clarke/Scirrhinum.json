    "Characteristics" : [ "Burnett is my authority for this nosode. He proved it on himself, and produced \"a tremendous sinking at the navel,\" which he regarded as a keynote for its use. Scirrh. has aided the cure of many cases of breast tumour in Burnett's hands. With it he cured a man of hard glands which appeared on the left side of the neck after other glands had been removed by the patient's brother, a surgeon. Haemorrhages and varicosis of legs and feet, with purple points, have also been cured by Burnett with Scirrh. A patient to whom Burnett had given Scirrh. mentioned to him that it had caused the passage of an enormous number of threadworms. On this hint Burnett gave it with great success in many cases of this troublesome complaint; and I have verified this experience. In inveterate cases where Cina and Teucr. have given little relief, Scirrh. has wrought a great change for the better. The time of < of Scirrh. is from to p.m., and irregularly on through the night." ],
