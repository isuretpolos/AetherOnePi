    "Clinical" : [ "Croup." ],
    "Characteristics" : [ "Sanginarin. is a pearly white substance. In smallest physiological doses it acts as \"expectorant,\" in large it causes nausea, and still larger vomiting. In repeated doses it lowers the pulse rate (Thomas, quoted C. D. P.). T. Nichol gives in Hale's work his experience with it solution of one grain of Sanguinarin. in two ounces of vinegar in cases of Pseudo-membranous croup. (He does not say how much of this he gave or how frequently he repeated: probably the dose was a few drops in water given frequently.) He relates this case: W. G., 5, had been ill some days. Nichol found him with a hoarse, muffled cough, complete aphonia, pulse Soft palate and fauces covered with pearly, fibrinous exudation; a hissing sound was heard on auscultating larynx. Great dyspnoea. The child stretched back his head and grasped his throat in agony. Features swollen and dark. Sgn. acet. was given, and in fifteen hours there was notable improvement. In forty-eight hours the boy was out of danger." ]
