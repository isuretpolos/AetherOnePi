    "Clinical" : [ "Cataract. Ichthyosis." ],
    "Characteristics" : [ "Burnett has recorded (Dis. of Skin) a case of ichthyosis in an aged lady, in which Platanus caused considerable improvement in the condition of the skin. Another case (Delicate Children) was that of a girl, 1/2, \"of the coal-black variety of the strumous, her forehead low and projecting,\" who was blind from double cataract due to the shock of a fall in the first instance, the lenses having gradually silted up. In this case Platanus O was given (five drops night and morning) for a number of months, \"with very evident improvement in the nutrition of the child's lenses.\" [Burnett names the remedy Plat occ.; but his tincture was made from the London tree, which is Plat. acer. It sheds its bark annually, which was the signature of its skin action.]" ]
